### Due to the existence of framing bias in natural language, we have developed Python narrative packages that includes [politicsnlp](https://pypi.org/project/politicsnlp/), [economynlp](https://pypi.org/project/economynlp/), [religionnlp](https://pypi.org/project/religionnlp/), [lawnlp](https://pypi.org/project/lawnlp/), and [cpanlp](https://pypi.org/project/cpanlp/), enabling us to communicate within a common framework and avoid misunderstandings caused by different frames of reference.
